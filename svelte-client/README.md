# svelte-client

## Developing

```bash
yarn run dev
```

This will start a live-reloading dev version of the client on port 5173, and the
back-end on port 3000.

## Building

```bash
yarn run build
```

This will generate a static site in the `build` directory.  You
can preview the production build with `yarn run preview`.
